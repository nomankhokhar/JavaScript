// What is Unit Testing?
// - Testing individual units of code in isolation

// Benefits of Unit Testing

// 1. Early bug detection
// 2. Facilitates Refactoring
// 3. Improve Code Quality
// 4. Documentation

// Unit Testing is an Investment in Quality

// Types of Unit Testing

// 1. Unit Testing -> Testing individual units of code in isolation like functions, classes, or methods
// 2. Integration Testing -> Testing how different units of code work together like testing the interaction between two classes
// 3. End-to-End Testing -> Testing the entire application from start to finish like testing the entire application from the user's perspective

// Unit Tests help catch bugs early in the development process

// Testing Frameworks

// 1. Jest   -> Experimental support, feature-rich, and easy to use
// 2. Jasmine
// 3. Mocha
// 4. Cypress
// 5. Playwright
// 6. Vitest

// Test-driven Development (TDD)

// 1. Start by writing a failing test.
// 2. Write just enough code to make the test pass.
// 3. Refactor if necessary
